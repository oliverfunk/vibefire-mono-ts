# Vibefire

**Vibefire** is a mobile app that helps people discover and share local events. You can use it to see what‚Äôs happening nearby, create your own events, and invite friends to join in.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **App** ‚Äì Built with **React Native**, **Tailwind (via NativeWind)**, **tRPC**, **React Query** and **Expo**, making it easy to deploy on both iOS and Android.
- **API** ‚Äì Runs on **Cloudflare Workers** for fast, globally distributed serverless (edge) functions.
- **Database** ‚Äì Originally used **FaunaDB**, a NoSQL database with a powerful query language and real-time support. After Fauna shut down, I planned to migrate to **Convex**, but didn't complete the transition in time.

## üöÄ Why I Built It

While travelling, I often found it difficult to find what was happening in an area, unless it was an obvious tourist attraction, a well-known ticketed event or a scheduled group meetup. I wanted a way to see what was popular with locals, discover hidden gems and find spontaneous events.

So, I built Vibefire, an event heatmap that shows you what was popular in an area.

I wanted the app to be:
 - Globally scalable
 - Free to use, unless someone wanted to promote their event

To achieve that, I chose lightweight serverless tools that could scale easily and run at a low cost.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repo is organised into three main folders:

- **apps/** contains client/user-facing applications and tools.
- **packages/** contains shared code, API, business logic, and integrations.
- **services/** contains backend services and APIs.

## üß† Final Thoughts

I‚Äôm publishing this project to showcase my full-stack development skills‚Äîfrom building a cross-platform mobile app to deploying serverless infrastructure and handling real-world data.

Vibefire taught me a lot about modern app architecture, mobile UX, and global-first development. Feel free to explore the code, and reach out if you‚Äôd like to chat or collaborate.
